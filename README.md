# DEPRECATED

Go to [tillkruss/homebridge-purpleair](https://github.com/tillkruss/homebridge-purpleair) instead.

# Homebridge-purpleair
**Homebridge plugin that is showing information about air quality from PurpleAir API.**

Project is based on [homebridge-weather](https://github.com/werthdavid/homebridge-weather) and [homebridge-arinow](https://github.com/ToddGreenfield/homebridge-airnow).

## Installation
1. Install Homebridge using: `(sudo) npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge`.
1. Install this plugin:
    1. find the directory that `homebridge` was installed in (e.g. `/usr/local/lib/node-modules`)
    2. create `homebridge-purpleair` in that directory
    3. copy `index.js` and `package.js` into this directory
    4. make sure the file/directory ownership and RWX permissions are the same as other modules in that directory
1. Update your `homebridge` configuration file like the example below.

This plugin is returning only: AQI (Air Quality Index) and PM2.5

## Configuration
Example config.json

```json
"accessories": [
    {
          "accessory": "PurpleAir",
          "purpleID": "PURPLE_AIR_STATION_ID",
          "updateFreq": MIN_SECS_BETWEEN_API_READ,
          "name": "PurpleAir Air Quality"
    }
]
```

## Config file
Fields:
- `accessory` must be "PurpleAir" (required).
- `purpleID` PurpleAir Station ID (a number).
- `updateFreq` minimum number of seconds between reads from PurpleAir API (a number - default is 90 seconds)
- `name` Is the name of accessory (required).

To find your specific "PURPLE_AIR_STATION_ID" (a string):
1. Use the PurpleAir Map to locate a station (https://www.purpleair.com/map)
1. Open this URL in a new Window or Tab: (https://www.purpleair.com/json)
1. Search for the NAME of the station you found in step A (*using JSONview in Google Chrome makes this a bit easier)*
1. The Station ID is the first element in the results[:] map - you will enter this ID (1-5 digits) into the preferences for the Air Quality Station
    1. If you have an outdoor sensor, there should be 2 entries in the big JSON file, one for each sensor. Please use only the FIRST entry - the code will find the second and average the values, as done for the PurpleAir map.
